Typically, clubs supply entry lists, so selecting the club first should make it somewhat simpler to record the entries.</p><p>In the Clubs listing, any clubs with existing entries are listed first, along with their entry count. All other clubs &amp; organisations are shown after that in alphabetical order.</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="club selection"></p><p>Once you&#39;ve selected a club, you&#39;ll see all the available levels for the competition listed, along with a summary of the entries per level.</p><p>Selecting a level expands the view to show the entry list for that club and level.

It&#39;s a last minute entry! We&#39;ll add the late entry to the session so they can compete, but we&#39;re not going to change the entire work order just because one gymnast wasn&#39;t entered until the day of the competition.</p><p>Keep in mind that adding a late entry won&#39;t show up everywhere automatically. You&#39;ll need to refresh any pages where the session work order is being displayed. This will include the score entry, scoreboard, and floor marshal pages.</p><p>And finally, if the entry is so late that scores have already been entered for others routines you can rest easy. Adding a late entry doesn&#39;t remove any existing scores.</p>',28),d=[l];function h(p,c,u,g,m,y){return a(),t("div",null,d)}const b=e(r,[["render",h]]);export{w as __pageData,b as default};
