No more clicking around to add clubs before you can add gymnasts. No more separate group and team entry areas. It&#39;s now all in just one single place!</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="entry card"></p><p>The first step when editing entries is to select the club you&#39;re working with.</p><p>Clubs with existing entries are listed first, along with their entry count. All other clubs &amp; organisations are shown after that.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="club selection"></p><p>Once you&#39;ve chosen a club, you&#39;ll see all the levels for the competition listed with a summary of the entries per level.</p><p>Selecting a level expands out to a view showing either individual or group entries. If the competition also allows team entries, those will be shown alongside in the individual levels.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="entry level details"></p><p>We&#39;ll even make sure that if you remove a gymnast from the entry list that any team&#39;s they&#39;re in are also removed.</p><p>Best of all? Any changes you make will be automatically saved as soon as you make them. No need to click a save or OK button, and no need to worry about losing changes after entering a large number of gymnasts.</p><p>Oh, for those wondering, the ticks you see indicate if an entry has been accepted or not. In a future update we&#39;ll add support for club owners to self-manage their entries so that competition organisers just have to accept or decline entries before each competition starts.</p><h2 id="how-to-add-a-late-entry" tabindex="-1">How to add a late entry <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-add-a-late-entry" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>To add a late entry, go to the session details via the administration area. You should see the new Late Entry button in each level&#39;s summary view.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="Late Entry"></p><p>Click the button, fill in the details, click on Add, and a new entry will be added to the competition and new routines added to your session.</p><h3 id="where-do-the-routines-get-placed" tabindex="-1">Where do the routines get placed? <a class="header-anchor" href="#where-do-the-routines-get-placed" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>The rules for where we place new routines depends on how your session is arranged. The main rule we follow is that we don&#39;t disturb the order of existing routines where possible.</p><p>For sessions with a <strong>single judging panel</strong>, routines are added at the end of the rotation.</p><p>When there are <strong>multiple judging panels and one competition floor</strong>, we&#39;ll add the late routines to an appropriate gap in a judging panel, else they&#39;ll be added at the end of the rotation.</p><p>And for sessions with <strong>multiple competition floors in parallel</strong>, we&#39;ll look for any empty judging panels and fill them where possible, otherwise we&#39;ll add the routines at the end of the rotation.</p><h3 id="notes" tabindex="-1">Notes <a class="header-anchor" href="#notes" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>We ignore rules around grouping clubs together, starting routines on different panels, and keeping all routines in a level together. It&#39;s a last minute entry! We&#39;ll add the late entry to the session so they can compete, but we&#39;re not going to change the entire work order just because one gymnast wasn&#39;t entered until the day of the competition.</p><p>Keep in mind that adding a late entry won&#39;t show up everywhere automatically. You&#39;ll need to refresh any pages where the session work order is being displayed. This will include the score entry, scoreboard, and floor marshal pages.</p><p>And finally, if they entry is so late that scores have already been entered for others routines you can rest easy. Adding a late entry doesn&#39;t remove any existing scores.</p>',25),h=[d];function p(c,u,g,m,y,w){return n(),t("div",null,h)}const _=e(l,[["render",p]]);export{b as __pageData,_ as default};
