# Defining a Session

::: tip
The initial steps needed to define a competition are covered in the Getting Started guide.
:::

Sessions are where you decide when gymnasts from different levels will compete, and the configuration of each competition session.

## Session Settings

#### Name and Date

The name of the session and the date when it will run. The date must be one of the days the competition is running on.

#### Times

Sessions have 4 times to give competitors, coaches, and judges the information they need. These times are:

* **General Warm Up**: The time at which gymnasts make commence warm up
* **Competition Start**: The time the first routine of the session will begin
* **Presentation**: An approximate time when presentations will occur. We recommend adding 10-15 minutes as 'buffer time', to cater for delays, particularly judging related delays.
* **Estimated End**: When the session will conclude. Depending on how you run your presentations and how many gymnasts are in a session this is usually 10-15 minutes after the presentation time.

#### Judging Coordinator

If you use the electronic judging feature, judges must be placed into panels. In some organisations panel configuration is performed by a nominated judge, not the competition administrator.

By selecting a person as the judging coordinator for the session, you are granting them permission to manage the judging panels for the session.

#### General warm up notes

A free text box where you can add any notes that you wish to appear on the work order PDFs. This is generally used for podium warmup times and competition hall entry times, but can be used for any purpose you wish.

#### Limit clubs in this session

For levels with a large number of gymnasts, it is often easier to split the level into age divisions (e.g. A/B or Junior/Senior) and to create levels using those divisions (e.g. Level 4 Junior).

However there are also times where you may wish to split a session; capacity constraints in the competition venue, for example. The *Limit clubs in this session* option allows you to split the session based on the clubs competing. The limits the session a club needs to be add and allows gymnasts from the same club to compete at the same session.

When you toggle this flag, you will see a summary of the entries per club. Use this entry summary to balance the gymnast count across sessions.

::: warning Impact on results
Split sessions will only have ranking results calculated for each individual session. RGScores does not provide an aggregated result as it cannot be guaranteed that the judging panels are consistent across sessions.

### Levels in the session

Select which of the levels in the competition will compete in this session. At least one level should be selected.

## Session Results

Once a work order is generated (see [Work Orders](./generating-work-orders)) the Level cards in the session will have a `Results` button on them.

Clicking this will take you to the Results view, where you can see the ranked results for that level.

If you look at these results mid competition, you can click the refresh icon at the top right of the card to get the latest results.

This view is where you can also create PDFs for the level results, should you need to post them online.

## Completing a Session

Once the session is over, click the `Complete` button in the bottom left of the settings card.

The completition status is reflected in the competition view that the public can see.

For competitions that disabled live scores, completing the session will start a 15-minute timer, after which results will be made visible.

If you accidentally complete the session, simple click the `Re-Open` button to reactivate it.
