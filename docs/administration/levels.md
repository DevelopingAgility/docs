#### Age restrictions

New in this update are settings to set age restrictions for a level. You'll find them in the [Options] tab.

Gymnast ages will be calculated based on the start of the competition year (i.e. January 1st) for the level and should their age be outside the allowable ages for the level, an error message will be shown to you.

Setting the minimum or maximum age to zero will indicate that no minimum or maximum age check should occur.

#### Competition year
The keen eyed amongst you may have noticed that there is a year is showing next to the level name in the screen shot. In a future update we will add the ability to copy level definitions from one year to the next, but for now just be aware that gymnasts ages are determined as at the competition year of the level and this is the year shown next to the level name.

When a gymnast's age is outside the allowed age range a small warning indicator will be shown near their name in the "all gymnasts" view in the administration area.
