These times are:</p><ul><li><strong>General Warm Up</strong>: The time at which gymnasts make commence warm up</li><li><strong>Competition Start</strong>: The time the first routine of the session will begin</li><li><strong>Presentation</strong>: An approximate time when presentations will occur. We recommend adding 10-15 minutes as &#39;buffer time&#39;, to cater for delays, particularly judging related delays.</li><li><strong>Estimated End</strong>: When the session will conclude. Depending on how you run your presentations and how many gymnasts are in a session this is usually 10-15 minutes after the presentation time.</li></ul><h4 id="judging-coordinator" tabindex="-1">Judging Coordinator <a class="header-anchor" href="#judging-coordinator" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4><p>If you use the electronic judging feature, judges must be placed into panels.

The <em>Limit clubs in this session</em> option allows you to split the session based on the clubs competing.
