### Unranked results & scratched routines

 In levels where the ranking of AA or apparatus results is disabled we used to show a zero score in the results. Scores would flash up on the scoreboard and would be shown on the live results views, but weren't available anywhere else.
 
 Based on your feedback we're now showing the routines scores in the results tables. To prevent people inferring a rank through the display order in an apparatus, the results are ordered by gymnast number (i.e. performance order) wherever possible.

 We've also slightly adjusted the display of scratched routines. Previously a scratched routine would show a zero score and the gymnasts would be ranked last.
 To make the scratching obvious, scratched routines are shown as unranked and their scores are displayed as "DNC" (Did Not Compete). These routines will always be shown at the bottom of the results tables to indicate that a gmnast entered the competition but either couldn't compete or had to be withdrawn.
