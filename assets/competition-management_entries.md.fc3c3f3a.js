Typically, clubs supply entry lists, so selecting the club first should make it somewhat simpler to record the entries.</p><p>In the Clubs listing, any clubs with existing entries are listed first, along with their entry count. All other clubs &amp; organisations are shown after that in alphabetical order.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="club selection"></p><p>Once you&#39;ve selected a club, you&#39;ll see all the available levels for the competition listed, along with a summary of the entries per level.</p><p>Selecting a level expands the view to show the entry list for that club and level.

This is in preparation for a potential future update where support may be added for club owners to self-manage their entries so that competition organisers just have to accept or decline entries before each competition starts.</p><p>Once done, you can either select another club to add entries for, or you can click the back button at the top of the entry card.</p><h2 id="timing-estimates" tabindex="-1">Timing Estimates <a class="header-anchor" href="#timing-estimates" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>When you have added entries, you will see a summary of the entry count per level.

Failing that, they&#39;ll be added at the end of the rotation.</p><p>Similarly, for sessions with <strong>multiple competition floors in parallel</strong>, routines are placed in any gaps on judging panels that may exist, and added at the end of the rotation if that is not possible.</p><p>This means that work order generation options such as grouping gymnasts from the same club together, starting routines on different panels per rotation, or keeping all routines in a level together are ignored. Since it&#39;s a late entry, and probably occurring during warm up, the primary goal is to allow the gymnast to compete, and to not disadvantage any other gymnast&#39;s preparations.</p><p>If you do add a late entry you will need to refresh any pages where the session&#39;s work order is being displayed. This means refreshing the score entry, judging, scoreboard, and floor marshal pages.</p><p>Routine mustic for late entries must be handled manually.</p>',33),d=[l];function h(p,c,u,m,g,f){return a(),t("div",null,d)}const w=e(r,[["render",h]]);export{b as __pageData,w as default};
