Now when you need to go and tell the judges to hurry it up a little, you can tell them exactly how late they are!

If there&#39;s no start time, we&#39;ll try the general warmup time instead.</li><li>We add the duration of each routine (based on the level definition) and time for gymnasts to transition to/from the floor when each routine should start. <ul><li>Scratched routines will be skipped and do not count toward the session timing.</li></ul></li><li>The standard transition time is 60 seconds per routine. It is 45 seconds when judging panels are operating in tandem.</li><li>For long sessions (over 2 hours), we&#39;ll include a judges rest break. If you go over 4 hours, there&#39;s a second break.</li><li>We provide a suggested time for that break based on a few simple rules <ul><li>If a rotation starts less than 15 minutes before the break, move it to the start of the rotation</li><li>If a rotation ends less than 25 minutes after the break, delay it until the next rotation</li><li>Otherwise take the break mid-rotation</li></ul></li></ol><p>If you do something different, let us know.

This timing information will not be visible anywhere else in the system.</p><p>Finally, since we work out the break time on the fly, we don&#39;t currently let you adjust when a suggested break occurs. We may adjust this in the future, but we&#39;d like you to try this approach first and give us feedback.</p><p>Thanks! And good luck with your next competition, whenever that may be!</p>',14),n=[r];function a(h,l,d,u,c,p){return o(),t("div",null,n)}const f=e(s,[["render",a]]);export{w as __pageData,f as default};
